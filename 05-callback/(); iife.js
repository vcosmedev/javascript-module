// IIFE

(function(){

})();

/*

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

It is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains two major parts:

1- The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (). 
This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.


2- The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.
